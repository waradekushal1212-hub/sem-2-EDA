# Lab Report: Python Programming Fundamentals
**Course:** Computer Science 101  
**Subject:** Exploration of Core Syntax and Operations

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This report documents the procedural exploration of Python’s foundational syntax. The objective was to evaluate the language's efficiency in handling user-defined data, mathematical computation, and memory management through the development of a functional arithmetic tool.

## 2. Experimental Objectives
* To analyze the behavior of **dynamically typed** variables.
* To implement data transformation via **Type Casting**.
* To differentiate between **Mutable** and **Immutable** memory structures.
* To utilize integrated development environments (IDEs) including **Jupyter Notebook** and **Google Colab**.

## 3. Technical Theory

### 3.1 Language Architecture
Python (est. 1991) is an interpreted, high-level language designed for code readability. Unlike lower-level languages (e.g., C++), Python utilizes an automated garbage collector for memory management, reducing the complexity of resource allocation.

### 3.2 Data Structures and Mutability
A critical component of the study involved the classification of data types based on their ability to be modified post-instantiation. 



* **Immutable (Fixed):** Strings, Tuples, Integers.
* **Mutable (Variable):** Lists, Dictionaries, Sets.

### 3.3 The Input-Process-Output (IPO) Model
The experiment followed the standard IPO model:
1.  **Input:** Captured via `input()`, initially stored as string data.
2.  **Process:** Conversion of strings to `float` or `int` for arithmetic compatibility.
3.  **Output:** Delivery of processed data to the console using the `print()` function.

## 4. Operator Classification
The following operators were tested and verified for logical accuracy:

| Category | Examples | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Arithmetic** | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` | Mathematical computation. |
| **Logical** | `and`, `or`, `not` | Boolean evaluation. |
| **Comparison** | `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<` | Relationship testing between operands. |
| **Assignment** | `=`, `+=`, `-=` | Variable value allocation. |

## 5. Industrial Significance
Python’s ecosystem, supported by libraries such as `pandas` (data analysis) and `math` (advanced calculus), makes it a prerequisite in modern engineering. From **NASA’s** propulsion data sets to **Spotify’s** backend recommendation engines, the language serves as a bridge between rapid prototyping and scalable production.

## 6. Conclusion
The experimental results confirm that Python’s syntax significantly reduces boilerplate code compared to static languages. All fundamental commands, including type casting and conditional logic, were successfully implemented within a calculator project, meeting all criteria for basic programmatic proficiency.
