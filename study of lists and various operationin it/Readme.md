# List and Its Operations in Python

## Introduction
Python lists are one of the most commonly used data structures. They store data in an ordered manner and can hold elements of different data types. Unlike fixed-size arrays, lists are dynamic and mutable, which means elements can be updated, inserted, or removed after the list is created. This experiment focuses on understanding list creation, indexing, slicing, and basic list operations.
